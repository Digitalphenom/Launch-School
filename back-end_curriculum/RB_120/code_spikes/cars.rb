## CARS SPIKE
# There is a vehicle company called Cool Car Factory
# There are 3 trucks and two cars there.

# A (oblue garbage truck) has orange wheels and picks up garbage 

# An (orange recycling truck) has blue wheels and picks up recycling 

# A (purple car) called Do Not Touch Anything Dirty has black wheels and if it touches something dirty says "hey don't touch any dirty stuff!" 

# a (green race car) that races and has black wheels 

# A (red firetruck) with black wheels that puts out fires 

# All truck/car's of these types would have these same attributes and you can pass only one argument on instantiation
